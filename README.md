# Dialog-State-Tracking-Challenge-2-3

I came across this project during my Dialogue Systems Course at the University of Bonn.  The whole project is not completely optimal solution and I am working on it. 

The project is outlined as follows:

Train and test dataset can be obtained from the following links:

Train:    https://github.com/matthen/dstc/releases/download/v1/dstc2_traindev.tar.gz

Test: https://github.com/matthen/dstc/releases/download/v1/dstc2_test.tar.gz


GloVe word embedding can be obtained from the following link:
Glove: https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip

The project is divided into 3 parts:

1. Downloading and Loading the Data
2. Implementing the Dataset Class
3. Building the Neural Net to Detect if the “inform” act occurs or not (binary classification)
